VOID Engine's list of capabilities include:
- OBJ and Material loader
- 3D Model rendering
- Game scene system
- Frustum culling
- Entity-Component system
- GJK collisions detection
- OBB collisions detection
- Ray casting + ray collisions detection
- Simple collisions response
- Physics system for GameObjects
- AI system for GameObjects
  - A* algorithm
- StateMachine capabilities
- Timers
- Spatial partitioning
- Debugging
- User input and event listeners
- Light source rendering with multiple types of lights
  - Spot lights
  - Point lights
  - Direction lights
- Skybox rendering
- SceneGraph system
- Collection of basic shaders

Some basic pre-created scenes are included in the engine to showcase how to use some of the functions. There is also user documentation available.
